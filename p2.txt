1. Enrollment of Celeb Images
For each image in a dataset, this function creates a face descriptor. 
The dataset is divided into subfolders, each of which belongs to a distinct individual. 
The code initially retrieves the person's name from the label map for each subdirectory. 
Then, all of the picture files in that subfolder are read in. 
The method reads the picture from each image file using OpenCV before converting it from BGR color space to RGB. 
The method then employs Dlib's face detector to identify faces in the image and Dlib's shape predictor to identify facial landmarks for each identified face.
The method then computes a face descriptor for each recognized face using Dlib's face recognizer. 
The face descriptors and the associated person's name are kept in a list.
2. Testing
The closest match for each test image in the "test-images" directory is determined by this code using the face descriptors that were previously constructed. 
The algorithm first reads each test image using OpenCV before converting it from BGR color space to RGB. 
The method then employs Dlib's face detector to identify faces in the image and Dlib's shape predictor to identify facial landmarks for each identified face. 
The method then computes a face descriptor for the discovered face using Dlib's face recognizer. 
The closest match is found by comparing this face descriptor to all those previously created by the programme.
The code assumes there is a match and prints the name of the closest match if the gap between the closest match and the closest match is less than 0.55. 
The code prints "No Look-Alike Found for the Test Image" if there isn't a match. 
The code also shows the test image and the image of the closest match.
